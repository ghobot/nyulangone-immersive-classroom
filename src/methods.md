The Mozilla Hubs platform was chosen for in-house produced XR educational activities because of its accessibility and ease of customization and deployment. However, 3D assets needed to first be developed in other programs and imported.

## Model Sculpting
First, Kristen Ramirez uses Adobe Medium in a virtual reality headset to sculpt the rooms and other assets for the Hubs experience. At times, reference models were imported and modified within Medium while other rooms and assets were built from scratch.

## Model Optimization

The model was then imported into Blender, an open-source 3D software toolkit. In Blender, the model can be optimized for the Hubs platform and components like physics-based lighting, rendering to the texture, and animations can be added. 


## Scene Creation 
The model is then imported as a glTF Binary file (.GLB)  into Hubs 3D scene editor Spoke. Spoke allows for asset management, discovery, and placement in the environment. The editing of the model and scene in Blender and Spoke was executed by Greg Dorsainville. Once the scene is set, the content can be uploaded to Hubs to share.

## User Orientation
Three different tutorial rooms have been built out thus far: two for desktop-based experiences and one for VR. Time permitting, these tutorial rooms have been deployed from immediately to up to one week before a given Hubs based educational intervention. Each tutorial is a simplified room that directs students how to navigate the spaces and use commands to interact with the digital assets. Each was curated to the types of interactions and prompts present in the corresponding educational room and encouraged exploration of the space to highlight the immersive capabilities of the platform.
