The [Mozilla Hubs platform](https://hubs.mozilla.com/) was chosen for in-house produced XR educational activities because of its accessibility and ease of customization and deployment. However, 3D assets needed to first be developed in other programs and imported.

## Model Sculpting
First, Kristen Ramirez uses Adobe Medium in a virtual reality headset to sculpt the rooms and other assets for the Hubs experience. At times, reference models were imported and modified within Medium while other rooms and assets were built from scratch.

## Model and Scene Optimization


The model was then imported into Blender, an open-source 3D software toolkit. In Blender, the model can be optimized for the Hubs platform and components like physics-based lighting, rendering to the texture, and animations can be added.

## Scene Creation 
The model was then imported into Blender, an open-source 3D software toolkit. In Blender, the model can be optimized for the Hubs platform and components like physics-based lighting, texture baking, hubs specific add-ons and animations can be added and then exported as a .glb 3D file that is supported in Hubs. Baked texture atlases can reduce scene files sizes and reduce the need for real-time lighting, making the experience run smoothly on most devices.

We highly recommend joining the [Mozilla Hubs Discord](https://hubs.mozilla.com/discord)  with an active community and lively conversation about unlocking this platform!

## User Orientation
Three different tutorial rooms have been built out thus far: two for desktop-based experiences and one for VR. Time permitting, these tutorial rooms have been deployed from immediately to up to one week before a given Hubs based educational intervention. Each tutorial is a simplified room that directs students how to navigate the spaces and use commands to interact with the digital assets. Each was curated to the types of interactions and prompts present in the corresponding educational room and encouraged exploration of the space to highlight the immersive capabilities of the platform.
